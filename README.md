# Yoga-pose-classification

This repo contains an ipynb solution to kaggle competition found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ukraine-ml-bootcamp-2023/).
In short, the task is to classify yoga poses into 6 different classes, given a training dataset of ~2.5k images.

# The solution

The given solution fine-tunes a RegNetX040 model pretrained on ImageNet. It obtains around 0.88 test accuracy. It utilizes Tensorflow framework (using Keras API).

# How to run

To run the code, go to the competition by this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ukraine-ml-bootcamp-2023/) and open the new notebook. Then import the
ipynb file.
